This is my senior design project for Hofstra University's Senior Design class. Developed using React and Firebase.

The VoteSource application acts as a resource for voters to find information on politicians in Nassau/Suffolk Countys. Users can search for a politician by their name, party, or position and access their personal websites and Twitter/Facebook accounts.

Politicians can also use the application in order to post their profiles for voters to see.

Politician data is stored in a Firebase Cloud Firestore database and displayed/updated in real-time.
